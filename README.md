# Best-Career-Options-in-the-USA-for-Indian-Students
The USA is not only famous for its best career courses that can turn one’s life around but also for the post-study employment opportunities that it offers. In June 2020, nearly 4.8 million jobs were added to the US economy. This is not to say that the country hasn’t seen its fair share of unemployment rates in the perilous times of the pandemic. Nonetheless, it keeps on adding jobs or at least a fighting chance for every prospective candidate out there. For international students, the most in-demand job sectors in the US are technology, healthcare, and business management. Students from all over the world pursue the best courses in demand in the USA.
